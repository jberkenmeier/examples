PEER REVIEW

1. The current programming assignment is building the smash program. This program acts as a shell, 
which records the commands the user inputs and allows you to do certain things such as changing the directory,
or printing out the history of your commands. The next part of smash that we are about to start will add more
funtionality to the program by allowing you to fork/exec certain commands like listing files in the directory.

2. The goal of this programming assignment is to practive modular coding, which means breaking up your code into 
different functions to perfom certain tasks. Anther goal is to help to learn how to code in C using these functions, as
well as using things such as pointers to be able to parse out commands. With the current assignment smash 3, we will 
be using fork and exec functions to help us understand the process of creating/managing processes.

3. Review of Robins smash project:

  Readability (2/2): His code was easy to follow, and all the variables seemed to be named properly for what
  they were being used for. While reading the code, along with comments, I could clearly see what each part
  of his program was doing/performing. 
  
  Structure (2/2): The code was structured very well. He had helper functions written at the top to perform various tasks for 
  his program, and they were used accordingly in the main function at the bottom. 
  
  Testing (2/2): Used valgrind for testing and manual testing.


Reflection: I agree with the score I was given, and his feedback was positive. He liked the way I split up
my program into functions, had comments explaining what each did, and only had to call one of them in main.
