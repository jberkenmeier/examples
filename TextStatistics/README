# Project 4: Text Statistics

* Author:   Josh Berkenmeier
* Class:    CS121 Section 01
* Semester: Fall 2016

## Overview

The programs in this project will take files from the user and scan through the files to collect text statistics and return the information back to the user.

## Compiling and Using
To compile type javac ProcessText.java into the console, then to run and use type java ProcessText followed right after by the textfile names you wish to run statistics on. "Usage: java ProcessText file1 [file2]..."

## Discussion
I felt that this project was pretty straight foward and was quick to finish. I enjoyed it and felt like I had a good handle on the concepts that went into it. After implementing the TextStatisticsInterface I had all the return variables I needed to keep track of. For this I created static methods to handle parsing through the lines of text and collecting the different statistics needed as well as handling FileNotFoundExceptions.  This way I could just call on the static methods in the constructor to return the values. Writing the code for ProcessText was fairly straightforward as well. I just had to write a condition so the user has to input at least one textfile, and it give the user a usage message to show them what needs to be input.

## Testing
While writing the code for TextStatistics I tested my methods on Process texts by using sysout to print the values I was collecting. When my code was finished for the class I ran TextStatisticsTest and got a Passed! message for all the test textfiles. I then ran the files through autograde.sh on the console.
